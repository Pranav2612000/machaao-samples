The issue of customer acquisition has been plaguing the chatbot industry for sometime now.

Facebook's Messenger Platform, so far has been the only viable option available to truly get any kind of “traction” on your consumer facing bot.

Also, let's not forget the abilities of the Messenger Platform,
which are way ahead in our opinion than currently supported by Twitter, WhatsApp.

But that being said, the reach and the engagement has been severely impacted by the introduction of changes in Facebook Messenger Platform Policy
as well as the removal of the Discover Feature.

Even, if you were to look to WhatsApp as an alternative,
there is a marketing spend associated with promoting the phone number.

Such marketing spend numbers are generally not in the reach of independent developers or small businesses
who are looking to build deeply personalized chat bots.

Why MessengerX.io?
=============================================================================
With our unique learnings in the conversational space from processing over 2.5B+ messages from end consumers
in addition millions of active devices in our collective app ecosystem.

We see there is a gap between good chat bots and end users, alleviated now by the removal of Discover feature by Facebook.

We aim to bridge this gap between great chatbots and end users!

   How it Works? - MessengerX.io

When a person sends a message to your bot through MessengerX SDKs integrated inside publisher or partner app(s),
the following should happen.

* Our servers would route the incoming messages to the configured Webhook URL, where your messaging app is hosted.

* Using the Send Message API, the mini app or the chat bot can respond to the person on the Partner App.

As Darren Yau - Our lead chat bot developer puts it aptly,
“If you already have a Facebook Messenger based chatbot you can seamlessly launch
and expose your bot on millions of android devices within days if not hours!”

The MessengerX Platform is FREE for developers looking to build highly engaging consumer based chatbots.

Concepts

What is a Chatbot?

Messaging Apps or ChatBots are light weight programs that run inside an existing app
without any new installation required on the user side.

What is a Webhook?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Webhook is a REST endpoint url which denotes your custom functions / callbacks.

This is the end point which will receive any incoming messages destined for your bot.
