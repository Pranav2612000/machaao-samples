   MessengerX Multi Bot SDK - v0.751 - Beta - My Bots

The issue of customer acquisition has been plaguing the chatbot industry for sometime now.

The Messenger Platform, so far has been the only medium to truly get any kind of “traction” on your consumer facing bot.

But, the reach and the engagement has been severely impacted by the introduction of changes in Facebook Messenger Platform Policy as well as the removal of the Discover Feature.

Even, if you were to look to WhatsApp as an alternative, there is a marketing spend associated with promoting the phone number.

Such marketing spend numbers are generally not in the reach of independent developers or small businesses who are looking to build deeply personalized chat bots.

Why MessengerX.io?
=============================================================================
With our unique learnings in the conversational space from processing over 2.5B+ messages from end consumer in addition millions of active devices
in our collective app ecosystem, we intend to bridge the gap between good chatbot developers and end users.

   How it Works? - MessengerX.io

When a person sends a message to your bot through MessengerX SDKs integrated inside publisher or partner app(s),
the following should happen.
