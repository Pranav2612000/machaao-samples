What is MessengerX? (Draft v0.1.0)
=============================================================================
The issue of customer acquisition has been plaguing the chatbot industry for sometime now.

The Messenger Platform, so far has been the only medium to truly get any kind of “traction” on your consumer facing bot.

But, the reach and the engagement has been severely impacted by the introduction of changes in policy as well as the removal of the Discover Feature.

Even, if you were to choose WhatsApp there is a marketing spend associated with promoting the phone number.

Such marketing spend numbers are generally not in the reach of Indie developers who are looking to build personal assistants for end consumers.

MessengerX.io is a collaboration between MACHAAO and AppyHigh,
with an aim to aid developers looking to build and monetize deeply personalized messaging experiences.

Why MessengerX.io?
=============================================================================
With our unique learnings in the space and millions of active installs in our collective app ecosystem, we intend to bridge the gap between good chatbots and end users.

Concepts
=============================================================================
What is a Chatbot?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Messaging Apps or ChatBots are light weight programs that run inside an existing app
without any new installation required on the user side.

What is a Webhook?
-----------------------------------------------------------------------------
Webhook is a REST endpoint url which denotes your custom functions / callbacks.
This is the end point which will receive any incoming messages destined for your bot.

How does it work?

   How it Works? - MessengerX.io

When a person sends a message to your bot through MessengerX SDKs integrated inside publisher or partner app(s),
the following should happen.

* Our "servers" sends incoming messages to the configured Webhook URL, where your messaging app is hosted.

* Using the Send Message API, the mini app or the chat bot can respond to the person on the Partner App.

The MessengerX Platform is FREE for developers looking to build consumer based chatbots.
